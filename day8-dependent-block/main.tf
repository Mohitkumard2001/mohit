#this is a dependent-block 
#example - in the above case:
#-first we had given a instance 
#-then created a s3_bucket 
#-after we had given "depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.dependent]" to instance
#we can give vice versa also


#by giving this first the main one will create and after that the "depends_on" will create
